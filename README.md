## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Virtual Environment Issues

- **Error: No module named 'encodings'**: This usually happens when there's a conflict with Python environment variables. Use the alternative command provided in the installation steps that clears environment variables.

- **Command 'python' not found**: Try using `python3` instead of `python` on Linux/macOS systems.

- **Permission denied when activating virtual environment**: Make sure the activation script is executable with `chmod +x venv/bin/activate`.

### Google Sheets API Issues

- **"The caller does not have permission" error**: Make sure you've shared your Google Sheet with the service account email address.

- **Credentials not found**: Ensure your `sheet_credentials.json` file is in the project root directory and has the correct permissions.

### Messaging Platform Issues

- **Telegram bot not responding**: Check that your bot token is correct and that you've started a conversation with your bot.

- **WhatsApp messages not being received**: Verify your Twilio configuration and ensure your webhook URL is correctly set up and accessible from the internet.

If you encounter any other issues, please check the logs (`bot.log`) for more detailed error messages.
